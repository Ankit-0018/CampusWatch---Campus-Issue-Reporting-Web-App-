# Campus Watch 🚨

Welcome to **Campus Watch** — a platform that lets students report campus issues and track lost & found items. Users can report problems, upvote them based on urgency (critical, medium, low), and view or claim lost items uploaded by others.

This project is open for **frontend and TailwindCSS contributions**. Feel free to jump in and help make it awesome!
